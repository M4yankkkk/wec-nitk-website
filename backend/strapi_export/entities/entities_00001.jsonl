For example, in mobile apps, efficient memory management helps conserve battery life and maintain smooth performance, even when running multiple apps simultaneously. Similarly, web browsers rely on effective memory management to avoid slow loading times or crashes when multiple tabs are open. It also plays a critical role in reducing the risk of issues such as memory leaks or fragmentation, which can cause performance degradation or system crashes. A great example of this is how embedded systems in cars rely on memory management to ensure the timely and safe operation of critical components like airbags and braking systems.\n\nThis blog delves deep into the intricacies of memory management, highlighting its importance, key benefits, and challenges. We will explore how memory is managed through techniques like stack and heap memory allocation, drawing parallels to real-world scenarios. Whether it's mobile apps, web browsers, or embedded systems, understanding memory management is essential for building efficient, robust, and scalable applications.\n\n## What is Memory Management?\n\nMemory management refers to the process of efficiently allocating, using, and releasing memory within a computing system. Think of it as organizing a bookshelf: the stack is like a neat stack of books you access frequently and return quickly, while the heap is like a large, flexible storage area for books that need to be sorted and accessed over time. The goal is to ensure that memory is utilized in a way that supports program stability, performance, and scalability. Since memory is a finite resource, poor management can lead to inefficiencies or even system crashes.\n\nMemory management is primarily handled by the operating system (OS) and the runtime environment of programming languages. It determines how memory is distributed between programs and ensures that memory is freed when no longer needed.\n\n## Why is Memory Management Important?\n\nEffective memory management is critical for several reasons:\n\n- **Preventing Memory Leaks:** Memory leaks occur when allocated memory is not properly deallocated, leading to wastage and eventual resource exhaustion.\n- **Optimizing Performance:** Efficient memory allocation and reuse ensure faster operations and enable systems to handle greater workloads.\n- **Avoiding Fragmentation:** Proper management reduces the risk of memory fragmentation, where free memory is scattered into small, unusable chunks.\n- **Improving Stability:** Proper memory handling prevents crashes and errors caused by insufficient or conflicting memory usage.\n- **Enabling Scalability:** With well-managed memory, applications can scale to handle larger datasets or more users without significant performance degradation.\n\nWhenever a variable is initialized in a program, it is stored in memory. This process is called **memory allocation**. Once the program completes, the memory is freed, a process known as **memory deallocation**.\n\n## How Data is Stored in Memory: Stack vs. Heap\n\nMemory in a program is typically divided into two main categories: **stack** and **heap**. Both play vital roles but are suited for different tasks.\n\n### 1. Stack Memory\n\n- **Managed by the Compiler:** Allocation and deallocation are automatic and efficient.\n- **Usage:** Stores local variables, function calls, return addresses, and control data.\n- **Performance:** Fast access and management.\n- **Fragmentation:** Minimal risk due to its structured allocation.\n- **Limitations:**\n  - Cannot allocate large or complex data structures.\n  - Limited size, which may lead to stack overflow if exceeded.\n\n### 2. Heap Memory\n\n- **Programmer-Managed:** Allocation and deallocation are done manually during runtime, providing flexibility.\n- **Usage:**\n  - Stores objects and data structures that need to persist beyond the scope of a function.\n  - Suitable for large data that cannot fit into the stack.\n- **Performance:**\n  - Slower allocation and deallocation compared to the stack.\n  - Higher risk of memory fragmentation and leaks.\n- **Flexibility:**\n  - Allows for dynamic growth or shrinkage, limited only by the system’s available memory.\n\n### Comparison of Stack vs. Heap\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a090d532-72b9-43dd-8bed-b2c1a2bc24ee)\n\n\n\nBy understanding the differences between stack and heap memory, programmers can make informed decisions about memory usage, leading to more efficient and robust applications. For example, a programmer might choose the stack for temporary variables in a recursive function due to its faster allocation, whereas the heap might be used for dynamically sized data structures like a resizable array or a graph adjacency list.\n\n## Different Approaches to Memory Management\n\nMemory management varies significantly across programming languages. Here are three main approaches:\n\n### 1. Manual Memory Management\n\nIn this approach, developers have full control over the allocation and deallocation of memory. This is particularly advantageous in scenarios like embedded systems or high-performance applications, where precise control over memory usage is required to optimize performance and meet resource constraints. For instance, in real-time systems such as pacemakers or automotive software, deterministic memory management is critical to ensure predictable and reliable operations.\n\n#### Example: C/C++\n\nIn C/C++, functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free` are used for memory management.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int *arr;\n    //n is stored in stack\n    int n = 5;\n\n    // Allocate memory for an array of integers\n    //arr is stored in heap\n    arr = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n\n    // Check if memory allocation was successful\n    if (arr == NULL) {\n        printf(\"Memory allocation failed\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Initialize and print the array\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        arr[i] = i + 1;\n        printf(\"%d \", arr[i]);\n    }\n\n    // Free the allocated memory\n    free(arr);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n#### Pros:\n\n- Offers full control over memory.\n- Efficient for specific use cases where performance is critical.\n\n#### Cons:\n\n- Prone to errors like memory leaks and dangling pointers.\n- Increases code complexity and debugging effort.\n\n### 2. Automatic Memory Management\n\nAutomatic memory management uses techniques like Garbage Collection (GC) to handle allocation and deallocation. Garbage collection typically works by identifying and reclaiming memory that is no longer in use. Common algorithms include **mark-and-sweep**, which involves marking all reachable objects and sweeping away the unmarked ones, and **reference counting**, where objects are deallocated when their reference count drops to zero.\n\n#### Example: JavaScript and Go\n\nIn JavaScript, memory is managed by the runtime engine, which includes a garbage collector.\n\n```javascript\nfunction createArray() {\n    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    console.log(arr);\n}\n// Memory for 'arr' will be automatically freed after the function call.\ncreateArray();\n```\n\nIn Go, the runtime includes a highly optimized garbage collector:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    arr := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    fmt.Println(arr)\n    // Memory is managed automatically.\n}\n```\n\n#### Pros:\n\n- Reduces developer burden by automating memory management.\n- Decreases risk of common errors like leaks and invalid access.\n\n#### Cons:\n\n- Adds overhead due to GC processes.\n- Less predictable performance in real-time systems.\n  \n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42617869-e7d1-4381-a103-474f74b7eb8c)\n\n### 3. Rust: The Ownership Model\n\nRust introduces a unique approach to memory management through its ownership model, which not only ensures memory safety but also significantly influences concurrency and performance. By enforcing strict ownership rules, Rust eliminates data races at compile time, enabling safe and efficient multi-threading. For example, the ownership system allows only one mutable reference or multiple immutable references to a value, ensuring consistent access patterns without the need for locks, thereby boosting performance in concurrent scenarios.\n\n#### Key Concepts:\n- Each value in Rust has an owner.\n- There can only be one owner at a time.\n- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.\n#### Example: Ownership and Borrowing\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n    let s2 = s1; // Ownership is moved to s2.\n\n    // println!(\"{}\", s1); // This would cause a compile-time error.\n\n    let s3 = s2.clone(); // Creates a deep copy.\n\n    let len = calculate_length(&s3); // Borrowing s3.\n    println!(\"The length of '{}' is {}.\", s3, len);\n}\n\nfn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {\n    s.len() // Borrowing without ownership transfer.\n}\n```\n\n#### Example: Using `drop`\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let s = String::from(\"goodbye\");\n    println!(\"{}\", s);\n    drop(s); // Explicitly free memory before the end of scope.\n}\n```\n\nNote:We don't need to call drop() function in rust by ourselves.It is automaticlally handled by compiler.Whenver a function goes out of scope,this function is called.\n\n#### Pros:\n\n- Prevents common bugs like memory leaks and null pointer dereferences.\n- Compile-time checks ensure memory safety.\n\n#### Cons:\n\n- Steeper learning curve for beginners.\n- Can be verbose in certain cases.\n\n\nMemory management is an essential skill for developers. By understanding the nuances of stack vs. heap memory, manual vs. automatic approaches, and unique models like Rust’s ownership, programmers can build efficient, robust, and scalable applications. As systems grow in complexity, mastering memory management becomes ever more critical.","createdAt":"2025-01-28T13:25:53.056Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-28T13:28:19.673Z","publishedAt":"2025-01-28T13:28:19.669Z"}}

Remove the various layers of abstractions in modern computer science, and study one or more layer(s) of abstraction\n2. Create abstractions to manage lower level things and make them simple.\n3. Create something completely new to solve problems.\n\nProviding a roadmap for systems is a daunting task. It is mostly driven by ***enthusiasm*** (we are Web Enthusiasts' Club after all!) , curiosity, interest and a spirit of learning. Below are some thought processes which demonstrate what we are trying to say.\n\n> I wrote a simple GUI application in python --> How does my computer actually draw all those elements?? --> Window managers and computer graphics --> ∞\n\n> I program in C --> I use a compiler to compile my code and generate some output file which magically runs --> How to compilers work?? --> ∞\n\n> I wrote a simple full stack web application and have deployed it on an AWS instance --> What can the cloud do and how does it work? --> ∞\n\n> I program in C --> Compilers convert my code into instructions which are run on my processor --> How does that processor work?? --> ∞\n\n> I program in C --> After compiling, all i have to do is run the program and somehow magically it runs alongside hundreds of other programs --> My operating system is managing this --> How do Operating systems work?? (Linux better) --> ∞\n\n> I wrote a simple full stack web application and have deployed it on a service like Vercel --> How do such services work?? DevOps?? --> ∞\n\n> I wrote a full stack web application and have deployed it on AWS, and now thousands of people want to access it. It has crashed --> How do I scale things?? --> ∞\n\n> I wrote a full stack web application and have deployed it on Vercel --> How are computers around the world able to communicate with the server --> Networking concepts?? --> ∞\n\n> I wrote a full stack web application but I see all these terms like SSL, TLS, certificates --> Cryptography and its Math --> ∞\n\n> I want to create, maintain, package, deploy, run and monitor a big software stack (like IRIS) --> What are the best practices and how do I do this?? --> System design, Distributed systems and DevOps --> ∞ \n\n> I want to create a decentralised system of giving rent contracts to tenants, where the contract is triggered only if they pay me --> Smart contracts and Blockchain?? --> ∞\n\n> I am curious about how hackers exploit systems and write malicious code --> InfoSec --> ∞\n\nAll this may seem daunting, but remember, [you are NOT dumb, you just lack the prerequisites](https://lelouch.dev/blog/you-are-probably-not-dumb/)\n\nBelow is our attempt at a roadmap. This will be constantly updated, so definitely bookmark this page!\n\n\n\n## Operating systems \n| Resource                                | Description                                                                                                                                                   | Links                                      |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Dinosaur Book of OS by Silberschatz et al.**                             | Absolute classic book, easily available as a PDF.

{"type":"api::blog.blog","id":20,"data":{"title":"Fixed-Power Designs","date_time":"2024-05-16T01:15:00.000Z","subheading":"There are many reasons why companies use online experiments.","body":"TL;DR Sometimes we cannot estimate the required sample size needed to power an experiment before starting it. To alleviate this problem, we could run a sequential test or an A/A test. However, sequential tests are typically less sensitive and introduce bias to the treatment effect estimator. Moreover, A/A tests prolong the duration of the experiment and still don’t guarantee that the resulting sample size calculation is accurate. In this blog post, we present highlights from our recent paper (Nordin and Schultzberg, 2024), where we introduce an alternative that we call “fixed-power design.” In a fixed-power design, you start the experiment without an estimated sample size, estimate the required sample size from the currently available outcome data in the experiment, and stop when your current sample size is larger than the required sample size. We show that fixed-power designs can be analyzed using nonsequential methods without any corrections. The point estimator is consistent, and the treatment effect confidence interval has asymptotically nominal coverage. Not all forms of peeking inflate the false positive rate of fixed-sample inference. \n\nIntroduction\nThere are many reasons why companies use online experiments. Reasons could be, for example, the following:\n\nTo identify the best version of a product\nTo quantify the impact of a product change\nTo detect regressions before a bug reaches all users \nOnline experiments let you do all these things while managing the risk of making the wrong decisions. \n\nAt Spotify, some of the goals of experimentation are to learn what works, how well it works, and stop the things that don’t work early on. However, the extent to which we can achieve these goals depends on the experimental design and analysis. For example, certain designs promote early stopping but pay a price in terms of power — with reduced chances overall of finding true effects. Other designs instead focus on maximizing power, but at the expense of prolonged runtime because they don’t allow early stopping. In the next section, we dig into the most common designs for A/B tests, discuss limitations of common approaches, and introduce a new design that mitigates some of those limitations. \n\nSequential experimental designs: more than just sequential testing\nTwo of the most fundamental concerns of experimental design are when to stop the experiment and when to analyze the results. Experimental designs can be roughly split into two categories: fixed-sample designs and sequential designs. \n\nFixed-sample designs\nIn fixed-sample designs, the experimenter leverages power analyses, also known as sample size calculations, to set a predetermined sample size. The power analysis produces a required sample size that the experiment should meet. If it does, the comparison will have high enough precision to limit the risk of missing effects of a certain size of interest. The experiment collects data until the predecided sample size is met, at which point the statistical analysis is performed.\n\nSequential designs\nIn sequential designs, the sample size isn’t predetermined. In principle, a sequential design is a design where users enter the experiment sequentially and the experiment stops according to a rule based on the available data. The sequential design uses a stopping rule that only indirectly determines the sample size as it’s being evaluated during the experiment. The most common sequential design, often simply called “sequential testing,” stops once the test detects a significant result. \n\nIn the context of online experimentation, many recommend using sequential tests to detect regressions but recommend against using sequential tests for the shipping decision, due to power and bias concerns with sequential tests. See, for example, Fan et al. (2004) and our previous blog post on comparing sequential testing methods.  \n\nUsing a hybrid design\nIn practice, many companies, in fact, use a hybrid design. That is, the treatment effect is estimated and evaluated using statistical tests derived for fixed-sample designs. However, the design is sequential, because the experiment runs until the current sample size exceeds the estimated required sample size. The estimated required sample size, in turn, uses an estimate of the variance derived from the data collected so far in the experiment. In Nordin and Schultzberg (2024), we call this a fixed-power design — you sample new users until the power criterion, according to the currently available data — is met. \n\n\nTrajectories of the estimated required sample sizes for 50 experiments with a fixed treatment effect over sequential sampling. The fixed-power design stops the first time the estimated required sample size goes under the current sample size indicated by the light blue line. The blue lines are the two replications that stopped at the smallest and largest sample sizes, respectively. Their stopping sample sizes are indicated by the dashed lines. The dotted line is the true required sample size. \nThe graph above shows an example of how a fixed-power design can play out. To keep the graph easy to read, the sample size is kept small. In this case, the experiment stops very close to the true required sample size. In large samples (small-powered effects), as the required sample size estimator becomes precise, the region in which the sample size crosses the estimated required sample size will often be quite narrow.

Swiping and scrolling has been something ingrained in us to the extent that we end and start our day with it no matter how hectic a day would have been. An average user spends on social media more than 1/3rd of the total time he/she spends on devices. To be more specific, he/she would spend 2 hours and 23 min (approx.) on such platforms.\n\nAs a founder, pivoting on this can help build your business and amplify your customer base multifold. How? That’s what this article is all about. There are a lot of social media tools one can use to build your identity but to start with, you need to understand your business goal and to align the strategy with the goal set by you.\n\nSocial media for branding\nYes, along with the usual checks one has for branding; company logo, its goals and even the unique designs of the interface and so on, you can use Social media to reach a very large audience and drive your potential customers to your business. Through social media, you can easily engage with your customers serving as a medium to:\n\nLet your customers know how your product/service fits for their needs\nKeep them updated with all the major milestones your company has achieved\nLet them know on the upcoming events/promotions\nProvide curated content that can build the trust they would have in your business\nMake them feel connected to your business and to reach out to you easily\nConsistency in providing content for your followers (Consumers connected to you over social media) is what will help your organization go a long way. Again, this can be done by scheduling for posting the contents, with the help of a proper team. Pros? Shoot up your brand identity and visibility in the long-run.\n\nAs an accounting firm, you can provide quality content on tax-saving tips, how you dealt with a litigation case, and even share the latest news/updates in the market and much more. By streamlining and staying consistent with the content you provide to your consumers, they will place their confidence in your service and the value you bring to them.\n\nWiden customer-base and their management\nSocial media is the best tool to reach your audience (Study on the consumption). You can say that on average, a user watches over 8000 ads a single day. Imagine the reach your business could get if few of these ads are for your business. No second thoughts here again but yes, there’s no other medium that has so much potential to reach your target audience than social media. This will help in lead generation as you can reach out to individuals easily at the tap of a button, who could be interested in your business and what you provide. As a channel, it can be used to reach your customers and redress their grievances in real-time. In turn, this will make your customer feel more valued and show that as a business, you value your customers earning their trust and making them stay loyal to you. An accountant can easily get access to a much bigger market through social media. He can easily let the potential customers know why his service is what they require, and connect to a lot of individuals who feel the same.\n\nNetworking\nThis needs to be the key highlight; Networking unlocks the unknown potential of your business by connecting with like-minded individuals, your customers (both in present and in future), and to the opportunities the market offers. An accountant need not pitch how his service can outdo others by his physical presence, rather by keeping a check on your media presence can skyrocket your service. Networking is the key to your success as a service provider. Read more about professional networking for accountants here. Cross-promoting, collaborations, partnerships through channels of networking, influencer marketing are few routes how networking can stimulate your firm growth.\n\nInfluencer Marketing\nIn today’s era, influencers drive the generation. To reach the consumers today, the most efficient way would be through influencers. Collaborating and partnering with these influencers will ensure that your business stays on the top by widening the reach of your business, and easily convert your potential customers.","createdAt":"2024-05-16T15:47:20.081Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-18T15:43:48.843Z","publishedAt":null}}

","body":"[ETHIndia](https://ethindia.co/index) is the world's largest Ethereum hackathon, with speakers and sponsors from all over the globe promoting and celebrating the blockchain ecosystem. Owing to its scale, my prior commitments and my experience with only the Web2 space, I brushed it aside. 45 mins before the final deadline to apply, my friend Ashish Bharath called and asked if we were interested. With little convincing and setting priorities right (and lesser hopes of making it), team unETHical was born. \n\n## The Prelude\n\nHaving almost forgotten about the hackathon, we received an invite to be among 2000 selected hackers out of 21000+ registrations from across 69 countries - one month after registering. We were jumping (at least I was). But a late invite also meant less time to prepare. Half the team was sceptical and had other things scheduled - the team almost fell apart. But again, with a lot of convincing, cancelling other commitments (as important as exams) Rahul Pujari (the UI/UX guy) from Delhi, Abhiraj Mengade (the frontend guy) from Pune, Asim Jawahir (the IoT guy) from Kerala, Ashish Bharath (the Solidity guy) and I (frontend guy) from Bengaluru, were all set to attend the 36-hour extravaganza. \n\n## The Experience\n\nThe hackathon started off with a series of workshops on the blockchain, which were really helpful in getting us up to speed on the technology we would be using for our project. There were also multiple sponsor stalls and a beautiful main stage for an amazing speaker lineup. \nThe hackathon officially started at 8:00 pm, and that's when the real work began. The organisers provided a 24/7 snack bar with lots of good food and energy drinks to keep us fueled.\nThe next day was primarily spent coding and trying to get our project to work. We barely slept the previous night, and there were tons of bugs, especially in the IoT part of the project. I remember at one point, we were pulling our hair out trying to figure out why our device wasn't connecting to the internet 😂. \nAnother highlight of the day was the swag haul. Whenever there was a rush around a sponsor stall, we knew that a new batch of swags had arrived 😆. Each of us ended up with 11-12 t-shirts, caps, stickers, hoodies, badges, a mouse pad, bands……phew, please see the image to see everything! 😸\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/588a50a8-6245-4498-a6d6-28a4592b897f)\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/e0224054-0f02-4161-8d39-e9204c6c0e97)\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/a39f68d0-54bf-4897-84ae-e1c777f18d6f)\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/03ca038b-ddfc-44ee-8d77-eafdbcbd2280)\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/60eee8c6-d979-4e07-b9e5-ae42ec01d6f0)\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/c701b5a0-2aff-4125-84f1-e80e7f03b6c5)\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/d609aa55-4a5a-4b12-9c31-62cebfa0dfe0)\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/7e8d76d3-802e-4d72-bba1-20faf77968a2)\n\n## The Project\nThis section covers the technical details of what we built. Please feel free to move to the next section if you'd like. \n\n### Problem?\n\nThe government has set a target that 30% of all vehicles be electrically driven by 2030. For this aim to be realised requires that strong incentives be created for the manufacture, sale, and usage of electric vehicles. In addition, it is expected that the increased usage of EVs will substantially increase the usage of batteries to power them. Though technology is improving, the issue of battery charging is particularly troubling. Charging stations require a lot of infrastructure. A proposed method is to use battery swapping stations where you walk in and swap your existing discharged batteries with charged ones. But here also, there are two problems: \n\n1. Putting a price on the usage of the battery: Location aside - some features of batteries may directly affect their worth, such as the age of the battery and its historical treatment. Tracking energy consumption is also cumbersome. \n2. Difficulty in energy source attribution: An aspect of EV usage sometimes overlooked is that they are largely environmentally viable only if the source of electricity is also driven by renewable energy. Attributing electricity sources is a difficult process, however.\n\n### Solution\nBlockchain'ify' the station and the information of the battery. \nWhy?\n1. Immutable battery information storage: The blockchain may store information such as the age of the battery and its previous treatment in an immutable fashion, thus removing the possibility of misrepresentation to increase the price or lower the cost of usage.\n2. Attribution of energy source: Usage of blockchain to store information on the sources of energy used to charge the battery may help inform choice to incentivise usage of sources of renewable energy. \n3. Programmable transfers: Exploiting the ‘smart contract’ feature of blockchain applications would allow for more efficient swapping of batteries at charging stations since simple rules on costing can be applied on the basis of battery attributes and executed on exchange.\n\n#### How does ChargeSwap work?\n\n1. The user signs up for our platform. We made the onboarding simple for conventional Web2 users, by allowing them to sign up with social login in addition to the usual MetaMask login. Thanks to the Biconomy SDK. \n2. [Assumption for now]: The user is sent a battery by us with the ownership transferred to them in the smart contract. This smart contract is deployed on Polygon (the Mumbai testnet as of now).\n3. The user searches for nearby stations based on different parameters such as the availability of the battery, its source and the distance to the station.\n4. Upon arriving at the station, the user scans his discharged battery using RFID at the IoT-enabled device. The metadata of each battery is immutably stored using IPFS. \n5. The user is asked to pay the price for the charge required. The price is just a multiple of (100 - discharged battery %) written in the smart contract. \n6. Upon successful transaction, the IoT-enabled device interacts with the smart contract to swap the ownership of a newly charged battery and the user's discharged battery. \n7. The user can now insert the changed battery into their EV and get going. \n\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/280bc445-2d29-4ef0-8b6b-1432bbb44543)\n\n\n## The results\n\"Hackers, please submit your hack by 9 am!\" - said the announcement. Rushing through the final pieces, we made our last commit at 8:52 am. Now it was time to pitch our project to the judges and sponsors. After pitching to 5 panels over 3 hours, already exhausted, we finally decided to take a rest. With partial sleep, I checked my inbox at 3:22 pm. \"IMPORTANT - [ETHIndia 2022]: You're shortlisted for Top 10 teams\" - the subject read. Putting my specs to confirm, I started waking up my teammates. Every single one of us couldn't believe it, and we were ecstatic! \nWe presented our hack live to over 2000 people and a virtual audience through [YouTube](https://youtu.be/9rieTya8Yds?t=3908). Wait, it wasn't over yet. \n\nChargeSwap also won the Best Public Good by Polygon, and the Best New Module Integration using the Biconomy SDK with a total prize money of $6500+. Multiple investors and organisations, including the Govt of Telangana, expressed interest in helping to carry forward our project. We also met Mr Sandeep Nailwal, who not only recognised us but also appreciated our project. \n\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/a35a114a-eb82-4ac6-aad0-df67f753701f)\n\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/1ebf81b0-d2e1-42f0-b47c-6d3b82af0aeb)\n\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/525651f6-239b-4875-a93a-6fef87829c0d)\n\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/26822a6d-e628-4f6f-9778-19b2e0af2608)\n\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/4013a3a3-e888-4f3e-a5b9-f31517f44c76)\n\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/d841f325-f752-4b8f-a6e5-5ab30b826f19)\n\n\n![image](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/wec-nitk-website/assets/97223188/9646f5f5-8fd3-4c31-a1fb-47a1e45501d6)\n\n## Takeaways\n* It's all about the team.\n  \n  Find individuals that fit different pieces of the puzzle. Let each individual work independently and trust their skills. None of us had any idea about IoT except Asim, whom we trusted (at least a little). The same goes for other team members and their skills. \n* Your network is your net worth.\n  \n  Hackathons are all about meeting new people and understanding new ideas and opportunities. Talk to diverse individuals. They are nicer than you think.\n* Plan a little beforehand\n  \n  Have some potential problem statements researched beforehand, keeping in mind the theme of the hackathon. It's easier to find a solution to an existing problem rather than finding both. \n* Don’t underestimate your potential\n  \n  We saw people who had won coveted hackathons, received big fellowships, etc - easy demotivation. If only you believe in yourselves, will you able to triumph the odds.  \n\nFrom a team that doubted even its selection to attend the hackathon, and almost falling apart upon selection, to emerging as winners among multiple categories and being featured in leading newspapers - it all feels nothing but surreal. I can't wait to see where ChargeSwap takes us in the future! ⚡\n\n## Related Links:\n* [Project Link](https://devfolio.co/projects/chargeswap-3527)\n* [Project Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rieTya8Yds&t=3908s)\n* [News](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/nitk-iiit-delhi-team-makes-it-to-top-12-winners-in-ethindia-22/article66238923.ece)\n* [ETHIndia’22 Offical Recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6LDMJ2pdvk)\n* [ETHIndia Website](https://ethindia.co/\n)\n\n\n\n","createdAt":"2024-05-31T14:37:36.579Z","updatedAt":"2024-09-03T20:05:18.162Z","publishedAt":"2024-05-31T14:37:54.713Z"}}

CTF Intro Session\n\n![image](https://github.com/Shubham-Rasal/wec-nitk-website/assets/95695273/953e1b40-277f-4003-9d8d-a3b7777b131e)\n\n\nWe conducted a CTF (Capture The Flag) introductory session to introduce the participants to cybersecurity and ethical hacking. The session covered the basics of CTFs, the different types of challenges, and the tools required to solve them. We provide all the needed resources and guidance to help the participants get started with CTFs.\n\n\n\n---\n\n### 2. Linux Installation Drive and Workshop\n\nWe conducted a Linux workshop to introduce the participants to the Linux operating system. The workshop covered the basics of Linux, including the command line interface, file system, and basic commands. We also discussed the different distributions of Linux and their applications.\n\nNOTE: This event has historically been the starting point of many of our members' journey into the world of Linux and Open Source Software.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Intro to Kubernetes (K8s)\n\nA workshop on Kubernetes was conducted to introduce the participants to the world of container orchestration. \n\nIt starts with docker and then moves on to Kubernetes. The workshop covers the basics of Kubernetes, including the architecture, components, and how to deploy applications on a Kubernetes cluster. The participants also get hands-on experience with Kubernetes by deploying a sample application on a local cluster.\n\n\nDuring the whole journey, various small tasks are given to the participants to ensure that they are following along and understanding the concepts. And obviously, the SIG members are always there to help out with any queries.\n\n\n---\n\n### 4. WEC-CTF\n\n![image](https://github.com/Shubham-Rasal/wec-nitk-website/assets/95695273/dc0d8418-dde5-4134-957c-2ac2031117da)\n\n![image](https://github.com/Shubham-Rasal/wec-nitk-website/assets/95695273/9ebb01ae-ad19-4d34-a2b5-2f153f8a3449)\n\nWe conducted a Capture The Flag (CTF) event where participants had to solve a series of challenges to find the hidden flag. The event was open to all students and was conducted online. The participants had to solve challenges related to cryptography, steganography, web exploitation, and reverse engineering.\n\nAll the challenges are designed by the SIG members which makes it a great learning experience for them as well.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Lightning Talks\n\nWe conduct a series called the \"Lightning Talks\" where members present on a topic of their choice for 5-10 minutes. This is a great way for members to share their knowledge and learn from each other.\n\nThe most recent one had the following topics\n\n- Merkel Patricia Tree and Ethereum\n- How to run a C program?\n- Active Directory (how to exploit it)\n- Helm\n\n---\n\n### 6. Security Discussions\n\nThese are some of the most interesting activities that we conduct. We carry out regular discussions on various recent security incidents and vulnerabilities, and how to prevent them. This is a great way to stay updated with the latest security trends and learn how to secure your systems.\n\nQuite often these discussions are accompanied by a hands-on session where we try to exploit the vulnerabilities in our own systems in a sandboxed environment.\n\n---\n\n### Getting involved\n\nGetting into the Systems SIG depends mostly on your passion and interests. Still, we would like to give you some pointers:\n\n- You should have a passion for learning new things and a generally curious mind for taking systems apart.\n- Familiarise yourself with basic tools - command line, git/github, etc.\n- Participate in CTFs, (this will boost your chances of getting in)\n- Pick some language and get proficient with it","createdAt":"2024-07-28T07:42:15.388Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-14T04:48:18.618Z","publishedAt":"2024-07-28T07:44:51.899Z"}}

For example, think of a very good driver recording the drive with a camera to a particular destination. Say we have an autonomous car, which can learn to mimic that drive by imitating the recording captured by that driver. The expert trajectory in this case is the recording of the drive, and the agent is the car.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb51f53a-8432-413f-bc5a-50d335bf03de)\n\nThis blog covers 2 fundamental algorithms in IL, with minimal mathematics and technical jargon.\n\n## Why Imitation Learning? \n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is an approach where an agent interacts with it’s environment in different ways, and learns a certain behaviour. The basic terminologies involved in such a setting are — state, action, rewards. At a surface level, in each state, the agent can take a certain action (referred to as the policy of the agent) and receive a reward. The goal of the problem is to maximize the expectation of the cumulative future rewards, and RL helps to find the optimal policy to achieve this. When we consider our own self, such interactions with our own environment are a major source of learning about ourselves and the environment.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9641774-58e2-4fad-b27b-4cda83c2009a)\n\nThink about shooting a football at an empty goal (a goalkeeper introduces an another agent, which translates the problem to a Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem)- at the position of the ball set, we can kick the ball in a certain way (state and action respectively) and we can learn how effective our kick was based on if we hit the goal or missed. That is our reward signal, and we can learn the optimal way to shoot a ball based on our interaction. Obviously, other factors like the wind, the texture of the grass, our footwear can influence the way we kick the ball, and this information can be encapsulated in the state.\n\nWithout going in any depth in RL, we can infer a fundamental problem — the reward setting. Setting the reward function can be tricky in certain situations :\n\nSpare Reward Setting — In an environment where the rewards are sparse (for example in a game of chess where the only points you get are for checkmating the opponent), the agent finds it difficult to get a feedback on the actions it takes, thus complicating the learning process.\nAmbiguous Reward Setting — Often, it becomes difficult to define an explicit reward function, for example a self driving car. In the large state space we have (millions of different conditions in the driving process), it becomes nearly impossible to set a perfect reward for each state-action pair.\nHence, this is where we can use Imitation Learning (IL) for the same task. We can use IL in such cases where collecting an expert’s demonstration is easier than formulating a reward function to learn a policy. This eliminates the need to go through the process of reward formulation and can be more efficient in the cases mentioned above.\n\nIn addition, RL methods include exploration steps which are infeasible sometimes. Say you have an expensive robotic setup, which is used to navigate on mountainous terrains. We cannot afford to let the robot fall off from the edges of the said terrain, which could be a possible action to take under the pretext of exploration, which is common in standard RL procedures.\n\nImitation Learning methodologies help mitigate these shortcomings. \n\n## A brief note on State Only Imitation Learning\n\nState Only Imitation Learning (SOIL) is a subset of IL where the expert trajectory contains only the state information.\n\nIn a general IL setting, the expert demonstrations are : $\\tau = ({s_0, a₀, s₁, a₁, s₂, a₂, …})$\n\nIn a general SOIL setting, the expert demonstrations are : $\\tau = ({s₀, s₁, s₂, …})$\n\nThis raises a natural question : Why SOIL?\n\nIf you consider most of the real world scenarios, the access to the action information is often absent. If you consider the above example of kicking a football, when we watch footballers play, we do not obtain the action; such as at what momentum the ball is kicked, at what specific angle and the explicit actions of each joints of the foot for example. What we can obtain easily, is the state of the ball with respect to the player through moments in time. Thus the ease of collecting state information is a lot less expensive.\n\nThere are various such examples where collecting actions is possible, but it is not so efficient. In those situations, we use SOIL to learn the optimal behaviour.\n\n## Behaviour Cloning and Behaviour Cloning from Observations\n\nBehaviour Cloning (BC) is one of the most fundamental algorithms in Imitation Learning. It modifies the IL problem to a supervised classification or regression problem, where the states are the inputs, and the actions are the outputs. It is an offline algorithm, since it does not need any interactions with the environment. However, using the arguments above, we cannot rely on the presence of action information. Hence, we use Behaviour Cloning from Observations (BCO) that takes into consideration only the state sequences. The task here is to learn an \"inverse dynamics model\", which can be used to infer the actions given the state transitions. Once the actions are inferred, it is converted to a BC problem.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8720e0df-66a4-4ee9-81db-7e7e59e1b5fe)\n\nTo understand these algorithms, you can refer to the next section, where the processes will be detailed in the code.\n\nThese methods are powerful, but can suffer from compounding errors or the infamous covariate shift problem. The latter occurs when the agent finds itself in a state that is out of distribution to those it has seen in the expert trajectories. To solve this issue, we can use the Adversarial Imitation Learning class of algorithms. (Will be discussed in a future blog!)\n\n## Let's Code!\n\nIn this section, I will be coding out Behaviour Cloning from Observations, which will cover the BC fundamentals as well. \n\nLet's proceed with the necessary imports. \n```\nimport gymnasium as gym\nimport sys\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\nfrom stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv\nimport torch \nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport torch.optim as optim\n```\nWe will use the OpenAI Gym environments. \n```\nenv_name = \"CartPole-v1\" \nenv = gym.make(env_name)\n```\nWe first parameterize the policy with a neural network : \n```\nclass Policy(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):\n        super(MLP, self).__init__()\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 256)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 256)\n        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(256, 256)\n        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(256, output_dim)\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))\n        x = F.relu(self.fc3(x))\n        x = torch.tanh(self.fc4(x))\n        return x\n```\nOur next step is to initialize the Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM). This is also a neural network, and takes the state transition $(s,s')$ as an input, and outputs an action a such that applying the action $a$ in state s leads to the next state $s'$.\n\n```\nclass InverseDynamics(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_space):\n        super(InverseDynamics, self).__init__()\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_dim*2, 256)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 256)\n        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(256, action_space)\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))\n        x = self.fc3(x)\n        return x\n```\n\nTo learn the IDM, we sample rollouts from the policy with the following function : \n\n```\ndef collect_trajectories(env, policy, n_episodes=100):\n    env = DummyVecEnv([make_env(env.unwrapped.spec.id)])\n    MAX_STEPS = 1000\n    expert_data = []\n    expert_actions = []\n    for _ in range(n_episodes):\n        state = env.reset()\n        done = False\n        step_count = 0\n        while not done and step_count < MAX_STEPS:\n            action, _states = dummy_policy.predict(state, deterministic=True)\n            next_obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)\n            x = np.concatenate((state[0], next_obs[0])) # x = (s, s')\n            expert_data.append(x)\n            expert_actions.append(action)\n            step_count +=1\n            state = next_obs         \n            if done or step_count >= MAX_STEPS:\n                break\n    return expert_data, expert_actions\n```\n\nNow we initialize the policy and the inverse dynamics model.\n\n```\nSTATE_DIM = env.observation_space.shape[0]\nACTION_DIM =  env.action_space.shape[0]\npolicy = Policy(STATE_DIM, ACTION_DIM)\nidm = InverseDynamics(STATE_DIM, ACTION_DIM)\n```\nWe now sample the rollout with the policy, and use it to train the inverse dynamics model.\n\n```\nrollout, rollout_actions = collect_trajectories(env, policy, n_episodes=10)\nrollout = torch.tensor(rollout, dtype = torch.float)\naction = torch.tensor(rollout_actions, dtype=torch.float, requires_grad=True).squeeze().view(-1, 1)\n\n#Model Hyperparameters\ncriterion = nn.MSELoss()\noptimizer = optim.Adam(idm.parameters(), lr=0.001)\nnum_epochs = 10\n\n#Train the inverse dynamics model here\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):         \n    predicted_actions = idm(rollout)\n    print(predicted_actions.shape)\n    loss = criterion(action, predicted_actions)\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    loss.backward()\n    optimizer.step()\n    print(f\"Epoch [{epoch}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item()}\")\n```\nWe can now use the trained inverse dynamics model to infer the missing actions, and then we can proceed with Behaviour Cloning! We assume you have the expert trajectories as ```expert_trajectory``` which contains the state transitions.\n\n```\nstate = torch.tensor(expert_trajectory[:, 0], dtype=torch.float)\ninner_shape = expert_trajectory[0].shape[0] * expert_trajectory[0].shape[1]\nexpert_trajectory = expert_trajectory.reshape(-1, inner_shape)\nexpert_trajectory = torch.tensor(expert_trajectory, dtype = torch.float)\nactions_expert_predicted = idm(expert_trajectory)\n\n#Model hyperparameters\ncriterion_bc = nn.MSELoss()\noptimizer_bc = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=0.001)\nnum_epochs = 10\n\n#Train the policy here\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    outputs = policy(state)\n    losses = criterion_bc(outputs, actions_expert_predicted)\n    optimizer_bc.zero_grad()\n    losses.backward(retain_graph=True)\n    optimizer_bc.step()\n    print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {losses.item()}')\n```\n\nCongratulations! You have now trained your policy using Behaviour Cloning!\nYou can evaluate this learned policy using the following :\n\n```\nNUM_TRAJECTORIES = 10\nMAX_STEPS = 1000  # Maximum number of steps per trajectory\ntrajectories = []\ntrajectory_rewards = []\n\nfor _ in range(NUM_TRAJECTORIES):\n    trajectory = []\n    rewards = 0  \n    state = env.reset()\n    state = state[0]\n    done = False\n    step_count = 0\n\n    while not done and step_count < MAX_STEPS:\n        state_tensor = torch.tensor(state, dtype=torch.float)\n        action = policy(state_tensor).detach().numpy()\n        # action = action.detach().item()\n        rewards += reward  \n        state = next_state\n        step_count += 1\n    trajectory_rewards.append(rewards)\n\n# Calculate the mean reward and standard deviation across all trajectories\nmean_reward = np.mean(trajectory_rewards)\nstd_reward = np.std(trajectory_rewards)\nprint(f\"Mean reward over {NUM_TRAJECTORIES} trajectories: {mean_reward} +- {std_reward}\")\n```\n\nFeel free to change any of the hyperparameters to observe the changes in the results!\n\nThis was a very naive introduction to Imitation Learning; there are a lot of underlying concepts which go beyond the scope of the article. I hope you explore the domain of IL further!\n","createdAt":"2024-08-26T13:43:46.158Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-26T13:43:49.043Z","publishedAt":"2024-08-26T13:43:49.040Z"}}

Games are very inter-disciplinary in nature and require a varied skillset. This is a roadmap that jumpstarts you into indie game development.\n\n## 1. Choose a game engine.\nA game engine is the single most important software that aids game development. It brings together graphics rendering, physics simulation, particles, scripting, networking and everything else you can think of. \n\nYou can always make your own game engine from scratch. The biggest studios on earth, like Rockstar, Activision, Ubisoft, Valve etc., have the talent and manpower to create their own from the ground up. But for everyone else, the default option is to choose any one of the 3 popular game engines.\n|Criteria|Godot|Unity|Unreal Engine|\n|-|-|-|-|\n|Capabilities|Strong in 2D, but not as mature in 3D|Strong in 3D, arguably the best for 2D|Industry leading 3D, very basic 2D support\n|Ease of Learning|Fairly easy to learn|Easy to moderate and extensive resources are available|Steep learning curve for the engine along with C++ with its own challenges\n|Language|GDScript (similar to Python), C#| C#, Visual programming (not as good as Unreal Engine)| C++, Visual programming |\n|VR/AR Support|Limited|Extensive support|Extensive support|\n|Ideal for|Indie 2D games|High quality 3D, 2D, AR/VR and mobile games | AAA games, photorealistic visuals|\n|Official Site|[godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org/)|[unity.com](https://unity.com/)|[unrealengine.com](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US)|\n\nOne more point that's not mentioned on the table is that Godot is entirely open-source meaning that you will never need to pay for anything, and your engine is entirely yours to modify and use however you want in your organization.\n\nI chose Unity in 2020 and haven't switched to any other engine yet. Consider the above table but also make sure to do your research before choosing an engine as this is an investment of your time and effort that will go a long way. \n\nMost basic-level game dev skills are transferrable between engines but as you go deeper and more advanced into an engine, your choice of engine will impact your projects more. For example, Unity makes learning and rapid development easier, whereas Unreal makes photorealistic visuals and implementing advanced features like [motion matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag7fSlEeKA&ab_channel=UnrealEngine) easier. There are trade-offs for all. \n\nIf you're looking to dip your toes in game dev, I'd suggest picking up Unity simply because of\n- The abundant learning resources available online\n- And the highest return on investment for effort spent at the beginner-intermediate level.\n\n## 2. Make a very simple game.\nNext, with your chosen engine, follow a popular step-by-step course/playlist to make a simple game from scratch. This first game will get you familiar with the engine's workflow, how the engine thinks of different entities and objects within a scene, how to deploy a game to a platform etc. \n\nThis also teaches you general game dev concepts and terms like the update loop, delta time, collisions, trigger colliders, ray casting, lerping and so on.\n\nMore importantly, you'll learn about engine-specific APIs and methods that help you interact with input, physics, UI, animation, sound and other parts of the engine through code. This experience gives you the ability to experiment with the engine by yourself later on. \n\nThroughout this process you will get familiar with managing assets in your project, and you'll also get familiar with the different file formats in a typical game dev pipeline.\n\nPlaylists I recommend:\n- [For Unity.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL&ab_channel=Brackeys)\n- [For Godot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&list=PLl2oEs37r06484f94aN2RwX5Z634WKHG1&ab_channel=Brackeys)\n- [For Unreal](https://youtu.be/1XjgLKrb4_M?feature=shared).\n\n[This playlist (General Math for Game Developers)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3Zl3wyJwWOpdhYedlD-yCB7WQoHf-My&feature=shared) is more like reference material. You don't need to watch all of it. But this is what game programming related math is at the most basic level.\n\n\n## 3. Asset Creation.\nAssets are basically all non-code files in your project. Everything from plugins, 2D/3D art, audio, shaders, HDRIs, color profiles, all come under the banner of \"assets\". But generally speaking, people say \"assets\" to mean files that are not generated by your engine, meaning **art, audio** and **video** and stuff you have to *manually import into your project*. Most medium to large organisations have entire teams dedicated to asset creation whereas indie devs like to partially/entirely make use of pre-made assets from various sources online.\n\nIf you're looking to create your own assets, here are a few resources to get started.\n1. 3D art: Choose a 3D Modelling tool and get started with tutorials. Most major 3D modelling tools follow the same workflow. I recommend the [open-source and yet, the industry standard tool - Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0J27sf9N1Y&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z&ab_channel=BlenderGuru)\n\n\n\tShaders give life to models. A flat plane 3D model turns into an ocean using a shader, a group of randomly placed triangles becomes a patch of grass in the wind using shaders.\n\tFor getting into shaders, heres some engine specific tutorials - [For Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbZYoSu1w8Y&ab_channel=DanielIlett), [For Unreal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsXB1PQdGx0&list=PLoHLpVCC9RmMMmW5eP1aAyJrTjxd46rx_&ab_channel=renderBucket), (Unity and Unreal both support HLSL, a language used for shader programming, and have their own GUI-node-based shader solutions)\n2. 2D art: Photoshop and other Adobe suite tools are the industry standard here. [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (an open-source photoshop alternative) is about half as good and covers basic use cases. If you're serious about 2D art, do look into drawing tablets too. \nComing to pixel art, I recommend [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). It's a great free tool and extremely fun to use. It has features that make it easy to export your art and animations to game engines. \n\n\t> The workflow for creating 2D/3D game art is slightly different from usual digital art. You need to consider factors like making your models optimized, consider [Level-Of-Detail (LOD)](https://www.cgspectrum.com/blog/what-is-level-of-detail-lod-3d-modeling#:~:text=Level%20of%20detail%20(LOD)%20refers,further%20away%20from%20the%20camera.), choosing a color palette, keeping art style consistent for your entire asset library, etc.\n3. Sound: Sound includes [music and SFX (sound effects)](https://youtu.be/dMkTdYmOgiQ?feature=shared). For music creation, you have all the popular paid tools like FL Studio & Logic Pro X. For some retro music, check out [Bosca Ceoil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZeZ75gM9p4&ab_channel=Brackeys) (an open-source music creation tool). For a look into game SFX and spatial audio, check out [WWise](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/wwise/overview/) and [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) and their adaptive audio solutions for your respective game engine. \n\n\tFinally, *if you aren't too keen on working on sound design*, you can just do the bare minimum. Simply adding some ambient noise and a footstep SFX will go a long way in adding to the user experience.\n\nIf your main interest lies in programming and you think you suck at art (✋) or don't want to do it, that's okay. There are millions of free assets out there that you can use in your game. Here are some sites I recommend:\n\n1. [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/)\n2. [Fab  (unreal marketplace)](https://www.fab.com/)\n3. [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/feed)\n4. [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/)\n5. [itch.io assets](https://itch.io/game-assets)\n\n> NOTE: For games with dedicated artists, you can follow a specific art style, color palette and have a consistent look & feel because all these artists work together. This is difficult to do for indie devs without dedicated artists as they have to use pre-made common assets from different sources and achieve a consistent and unique look, so just keep that in mind when thinking about your art side of things. Also remember that art isn't everything, gameplay is the most important part after all.\n\n## 4. Prototype, Experiment and Remake.\nThis is the most important stage of getting gud at game dev. In this step, it's all about gathering more experience with the engine and its various systems. Experiment with different platforms like WebGL, mobile and AR.  Simply trying new things and playing around with the engine will gradually make you a much better game developer. Eventually you'll decrease reliance on end-to-end tutorials and turn to resources like documentation, GDC Talk, blogs and other projects. \n\nYou think some game mechanic you saw somewhere is intriguing? Try remaking it on your engine. `Wall running`? `Growing wheat`? `Placing a C4`? `Hijacking a car`? If you get stuck, watch a tutorial. Or browse online forums. Or read official documentation. Or join discord communities and ask other people. Or, finally, just grab a pen and paper and scribble away. There's always a lead to follow.\n\nThe system you're remaking doesn't have to be something big and complicated. Check out the little book on top of Minecraft's enchanting table, [the way it opens up once you get close to it](https://tenor.com/view/minecraft-enchanting-profile-picture-gif-21242300). Even that is a simple, yet completely valid feature to remake. And your final result doesn't even have to be a hundred-percent accurate replica of the real thing. Your prototypes don't always have to lead to fully polished games either. It's about the learning that takes place through creating prototypes and remakes. \n\nIt is important to get proficient in your respective scripting language. Learn to program better OOP, become familiar with common design patterns and where & why they are used. Learn about intermediate-advanced features of your language.\n\nVideos / books I find interesting and related to this topic:\n- [Remaking Minecraft in 24 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj8gt_92c-M&ab_channel=SamHogan)\n- [Giving personality to characters using Math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPoeNZZ6H4s&ab_channel=t3ssel8r)\n- [HOW TO GAME JAM!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_NA_yTXOOQ&ab_channel=Brackeys)\n- [Game Programming Patterns (🔥🔥🔥)](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)\n\nBesides these general resources, you must look for engine specific resources to learn more about how you can utilise your game engine to the fullest.\n\nOn that note, you should check out game jams. Game Jams are like hackathons but based around game development. You are given a time frame, a theme, some rules and some starting resources/assets to make the best game you can. [itch.io](https://itch.io/jams) is the best site for joining and even hosting game jams.\n\n\n\n## 5. Design Philosophies.\nGames are made by people who don't just play them but admire them as a technical, artistic and design marvel. This section is about studying games and learning what makes them \"fun\".\n\n1. ***Low Level***\n\n\tYou need to be curious about what goes on under the hood. This section is more code-oriented and is similar to low level system design but in the game dev context. These are some examples on how your thought process could be when you encounter intriguing mechanics.\n\n\t> **Dishonored**:  `Stealth Security Guard AI`\n\t-> How to define a fixed path that the AI patrols (list of global positions)\n\t-> How to move AI Guard from one waypoint to another? (pathfinding algorithms)\n\t-> How to define the AI Guard's field of view and alert levels? (LLD system design)\n\t-> What is the minimum noise level that can alert the guard? (Sound system of your engine)\n\t-> How does the AI react when all hell breaks loose? (Testing edge cases)\n\t-> How to utilize state machines / behaviour tree patterns to design such an AI? (...)\n\t\n\t> **GTA**: `Hijacking a car`\n\t-> How does the auto theft take place? (Multi-phase, randomized animation and can be \"disrupted\" at any point)\n\t-> How does the player's hand always reach the door handle accurately when opening a car door? (Inverse Kinematics)\n\t-> How does your player behave when they die? (Ragdoll physics)\n\t-> How is the game handling edge cases where I suddenly decide to switch characters during hijacking? (AI takes over)\n\t-> How is that AI designed? (....)\n\n\t> **Valorant**: `Pheonix's flame wall`\n\t -> How are the starting and ending points of the flame wall decided? (Ray casts from the gun's muzzle)\n\t -> How is the curvature of the wall calculated? (Theres prolly equations that calculate it)\n\t -> What shaders and VFX (visual effects) go on the flame wall? (Combined work of the design team and technical artists team)\n\t -> How can particle systems associated with the flame wall be configured? (Think about various exposed engine methods available to you)\n\t -> How to detect any player entering the flame wall and subtract health from them? (check when player enters trigger colliders)\n\t -> How should other players in the lobby/network experience this wall? (...)\n\n\t> **Rocket League**: `Car Physics`\n\t-> Whats the optimal physics update rate? (Because real-time simulations are discrete and require a time interval between each \"update\" call of the simulation system. This is true for physics systems too. For a fast-paced game like Rocket League, the physics update rate is a very important design and performance decision)\n\t-> Should my car have *arcade* physics where every aspect of the car (speed, turning radius etc.) is under my control through edit-able graphs and curves (like Mario Kart)? Or should it have *realistic* car physics done through proper simulation of wheels, engine, gearbox etc.?\n\t-> For more info on this stuff, check out this [GDC Talk given by the developers of Rocket League](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEmiDM94IE&ab_channel=GDC2025) themselves\n\t\n2. ***High Level***\n\n\tHigh level game design is concerned with concepts like the audio visual cues, feedback loops, environmental storytelling, tension curve design, difficulty curve design, color theory and so on. All of which are delicately balanced for a good game.\n\t> **The Last Of Us**: \n\t-> How does the player always know where to proceed? (Directing player attention)\n\t-> You see a zombie that's chained to the bed with a handwritten letter on the bedside table. What story does that tell? (Environmental Storytelling)\n\t-> The more you look around, the better loot you get (Reward positive habits)\n\t-> Repeatedly harming innocent characters (Negative feedback loops for undesired behaviours)\n\t-> You want the gameplay at the start of the game to be simple but not too easy/difficult. Similarly, you want gameplay at the climax to be complex with many variables, but it still shouldn't be too easy/difficult. \n\n\t> **Valorant**: \n\t-> Skill trees, agents and map designs are a complex eco-system. \n\t-> You don't want one character to be too overpowered.\n\t-> If you change something small like Sage's wall lasting 5 seconds longer -> Entire dynamic of the game is changed. \n\t-> Or if you alter the verticality of a bomb planting site by placing a bunch of wooden crates -> many existing strategies are now useless and new strats pop up.\n\t\n\t> **Resident Evil 7**: \n\t-> How often must the villain show up throughout the game? Too many appearances will desensitize player, Too few will make the villain a forgettable character \n\t-> How should the tension curve be? Start calm by exploring an abandoned house, gradually increase tension, let the player spot the enemy a few times, ramp up the music, let the player discover more clues, initiate a jumpscare and a chase, tension peak, then find justification to bring tension back down, only then move on to the next arc -> No one tension level must remain for too long\n\nThe next time you play any game, be observant towards the design aspect. Think of why the developers made certain choices over other possible choices. \nThis is more of a study section than a practical section and will continue for as long as you play games. Here are a few channels/playlists whose content revolves around this topic.\n- The Art of Game Design by Jesse Schell (available online) (🔥🔥🔥)\n- [Game Design 101 with GMTK (🔥🔥🔥)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yomqk0C6kE&list=PLc38fcMFcV_vToz9Nvc_YQTNH8hkIQ2uC&ab_channel=GameMaker%27sToolkit)\n- [How it's made: Decoding game mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIzWlfbVORU&list=PLzDRvYVwl53ttN_5uyfqs3nnOn0Jd4s92&index=3&ab_channel=CodeMonkey)\n- [Level Design with Steve Lee](https://www.youtube.com/@stevelee_gamedev/videos)\n- [Why this _Half Life 2_ level is peak game design from Valve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-dsv8SJ-0&ab_channel=BenPlaysGames)\n\n## 6. Specialize in whatever interests you\nAt this point, you have a good *foundation* in game development. \n\nFrom here on out, you can expand out into anything that interests you. It could be game programming, design, computer graphics, music, art, or even super specific topics like level design, character controller creation, writing shaders, procedural animation, reactive AI, etc. \n\nLearn general software development concepts like SOLID, design patterns and version control. \n\nWhen you are serious about building a full game, look into how indie game developers build and retain fan communities for their games through low-cost marketing *even before the game is halfway done*. This translates to potential buyers (*wishlists*) on platforms like Steam, itch.io and Play Store. Look into the pricing and licensing policies of your respective game engine. (None for Godot of course)\n\nOne of the best parts about learning this skillset is that you can even put your game dev skills to use in **non-game applications**. Game engines aren’t just for creating games; they’re powerful tools for building immersive and interactive experiences across many industries. This opens doors to industries like architecture, education, healthcare, automotive, and beyond.\n\n1. Creating simulation apps for educational purposes for driving, flying and in the military. ([Unreal Engine used for Simulation and Training at an yearly military conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdCOyNyrdqc&ab_channel=UnrealEngine))\n2. How Unity was used to make a _realtime model_ of the [Vancouver airport](https://unity.com/case-study/vancouver-airport-authority) and of the [Port of Antwerp-Bruges](https://poppinswayne.com/work/709/apica-digital-twin/) .\n3. [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) is one such example of a person who uses Unity to do interesting non-game dev challenges like creating his own ray tracing implementation, simulating planet earth, procedural terrain generation etc.\n4. You can also create interactive experiences like [product configurators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qYRspV71n4&ab_channel=UnrealEngine) that help businesses by letting users customize their product and view the changes in real-time before purchasing it.\n5. With all the money poured into blockchain in gaming, there are many opportunities to explore how blockchain can enable in-game economies and digital asset ownership.\n\nThe possibilities are endless considering how versatile game engines are. \n\n## Conclusion.\nGame development is a vast and multi-disciplinary field that combines creativity and technical skills. Starting out can be overwhelming, but with the right approach and resources, anyone can create games.\n\nStay curious, keep experimenting, and most importantly, have fun with the process!","createdAt":"2024-10-31T09:07:08.591Z","updatedAt":"2024-10-31T09:41:41.961Z","publishedAt":"2024-10-31T09:07:10.405Z"}}

For many students at NITK, the question wasn't just about where to start—it was about finding the right community to learn and grow with. UniDAO 2.0, a 6-week Ethereum and Web3 boot camp, emerged as that perfect starting point, offering not just technical knowledge but also a gateway to real-world opportunities and lasting connections.\n\n\n## The Program Structure\n\nUniDAO 2.0 began with an engaging orientation session that set the tone for what was to come. The program welcomed curious minds regardless of their previous experience with blockchain technology. The selection process emphasized enthusiasm and willingness to learn over existing expertise.\n\n### Orientation\n<img width=\"1090\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 15 26 12\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/982f0c48-19d6-4a73-a2ce-7198dfe4285b\" />\n\n<img width=\"1100\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 15 26 36\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a56605a-dd14-445e-8be2-b1b8484b2d4a\" />\n\n\n\nThe boot camp's structure was thoughtfully designed to ensure steady progress:\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1094\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 15 27 02\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60007e85-383c-4ae6-8625-ed0f25ef74d1\" />\n\n- **Weekly sessions** with carefully curated content and practical tasks\n- An engaging bounty system with leaderboards that made learning rewarding\n- Hands-on assignments and real-world projects\n  - Students built AgriVerify, AI-NFT App, & MemoryVault through out the cohort\n- Preparation for major hackathons like **ETHIndia** and **Unfold**🚀\n\n## Learning Environment - Tools and Resources\n\nThe program leveraged various tools to create an optimal learning experience:\n- _**Discord**_ served as the central hub for resources, announcements, and community discussions\n- _**GitBook**_ provided comprehensive documentation and learning materials\n- Weekly materials covered everything from CryptoZombies for Solidity to Hardhat for smart contracts\n- Regular 1:1 doubt-clearing sessions ensured no one fell behind\n- Inspirational builder talks, including stories like \"Vitalik: An Ethereum Story\"\n\n## The Team\n\n<img width=\"1100\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 15 06 04\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fc51200-4728-4f5c-b6ba-8992860687be\" />\n\n\n## Personal Journey - From Learning to Building\n### Shivam's Experience\n\nFor Shivam, UniDAO 2.0 was more than just a program—it was a doorway to an entirely new dimension of technology. As someone who started with minimal blockchain knowledge, the curriculum's approachability became his foundation for growth. Each week brought new discoveries: from writing his first smart contract to understanding the intricacies of decentralized systems.\n\nThe hands-on learning approach transformed theoretical concepts into tangible skills. Shivam progressed from basic solidity exercises to deploying complex smart contracts, creating interactive dApps, and minting NFTs, building AgriVerify & AI-NFT App. The program's structured path helped him build confidence with each new project, preparing him for bigger challenges ahead.\n\n_\"Amazing seniors like **Mardav Bhaiya**, **Apoorva Bhaiya**, **Shubham Bhaiya** and **Ayush Bhaiya**... —who are the tech legends of our college—played a huge role in guiding us towards Web3. Their constructive feedback was invaluable when I was building **AgriVerify**, a decentralized platform to certify and verify crops on the blockchain. From integrating push notifications and IPFS storage to using NFTs for proof of origin, their support made the journey both insightful and rewarding.\"_, says Shivam.\n\n![Web3project](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b29d85bc-b93d-41ed-bf46-0039717126d4)\n\n\nThis preparation culminated in his participation at ETHIndia'24, where he and his team developed AIgentX, a groundbreaking decentralized marketplace for AI agents. The project showcased how far he'd come—from learning basic Web3 concepts to building a complex platform that combined AI with blockchain technology. \n\nHis team's achievement at ETHIndia wasn't just about the technical implementation; it represented the journey from curiosity to capability that UniDAO 2.0 had enabled.\n\nThrough the bounty system and weekly challenges, Shivam consistently ranked 6th among the top participants, demonstrating how engagement and dedication could accelerate learning. His experience proves that with the right guidance and community support, the leap into Web3 development becomes not just manageable but exciting and rewarding.\n\n![Hacker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25ee8a51-148e-4277-91c2-1fece3997a74)\n\n### Suyash's Experience\n\nFor Suyash, a second-year engineering student, the path to Web3 began with a realization and a friendship. After what felt like a \"wasted\" first year, he and his friend Vatsal discovered their shared passion for hackathons. Their initial team formed organically: Suyash with his frontend skills, Vatsal handling backend, and his roommate Vishruth bringing machine learning expertise. This early experience taught them a crucial lesson that would shape their future success: _\"team chemistry matters more than individual skills\"_, says Suyash.\n\nTheir Web3 journey truly began with UniDAO 2.0, a collaboration between Devfolio and the Web Enthusiasts' Club NITK. The application process itself was a story of contrasts – while Suyash and Vatsal applied early, their teammate Vishruth squeezed in just before the extended deadline. Fortunately, all three made it in, and UniDAO proved to be transformative. It was here that they found their fourth teammate, Shivam, completing their hackathon dream team.\n\n_\"Special thanks goes to seniors like **Ayush Bhaiya**, **Shubham Bhaiya**, and **Apoorva Bhaiya**, who patiently guided us and cleared our doubts. But if there’s one person who shaped my hackathon journey the most, it was **Mardav Bhaiya**. As a seasoned hackathon winner, he mentored us with insights, tips, and constant encouragement.He was there for us through all the highs and lows his belief in us made all the difference.\"_, says Suyash.\n\nTheir first major challenge came with back-to-back acceptances to Unfold and ETHIndia. \n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b9c4b60-034c-45c7-8044-8b48245e78aa)\n![DS1_6271](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6afc365-7f2f-4373-bcb5-4f71ae4a469d)\n![DS1_6411](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/817f29ab-c001-4d05-bd3f-2788cc9e313d)\n\n\nAt Unfold, they developed [JusticeChain](https://github.com/marcdhi/JusticeChain), an ambitious project targeting India's legal system backlog. The platform featured AI-powered judges, interactive legal simulations, and a decentralized courtroom with smart evidence verification. Despite winning a track prize, the experience taught them valuable lessons about focus, preparation, and the importance of effective presentation.\n\nETHIndia marked their next milestone. Armed with lessons from Unfold, they pivoted to create AIgentX, a decentralized marketplace for AI agents. The project showcased their growth – featuring custom AI agent creation, tokenization, multi-language support, and autonomous on-chain wallets. Despite coordination challenges and fierce competition, they secured another track pool prize and earned _0.42 ETH_ 🔥 through quadratic voting.\n\nThe hackathon experiences taught them priceless lessons:\n- Starting small and building up gradually\n- The critical importance of team dynamics\n- The value of networking and community building\n- Strategic focus in choosing tracks and problem statements\n- Adaptability in the face of challenges\n\nToday, Suyash and his team are taking their learning further, refining JusticeChain based on user feedback and expert consultations. Their journey exemplifies how UniDAO 2.0 serves not just as a learning platform but as a springboard for ambitious builders in the Web3 space.\n\nThrough setbacks and successes, Suyash's story embodies the UniDAO spirit – showing how curiosity, persistence, and community support can transform novice developers into confident Web3 builders. His experience proves that the path to success isn't just about coding skills; it's about building relationships, learning from failures, and maintaining the courage to keep pushing boundaries.\n\n\n## Key Takeaways and Future Impact\n\n<img width=\"594\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 16 37 39\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e7db87d-cc08-46f6-a086-e709a134373b\" />\n\nUniDAO 2.0's success lies in its holistic approach to Web3 education:\n- Creating a supportive community that encourages exploration and innovation\n- Providing structured learning with practical applications\n- Offering opportunities for real-world project development\n- Building networks that extend beyond the program\n\n### Celebrating Our Builders' Success at Unfold'24\n\n<img width=\"1095\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 15 36 22\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23275658-46c0-4c67-99af-4974a2538422\" />\n\n### **Team Higgs -

But, what if we could combine these forms of data to give our model a chance at making more complete predictions? Multimodal learning in machine learning is a type of learning where the model is trained to understand and work with multiple forms of input data, such as text, images, and audio.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dae9b6b-81d9-418e-9f16-9a39e1821d3d)\n\n## Why even use multiple modalities?\n\nMultimodal machine learning is gaining traction because of how it can imitate the way humans naturally process information from several different sources. These different types of data sources correspond to different modalities of the world. The world can be seen, heard, or described in words. For a ML model to be able to perceive the world in all of its complexity and understanding different modalities is a useful skill. \nIt is an approach that is becoming increasingly relevant in applications in fields such as healthcare. For example, combining patient records with medical images can lead to more accurate diagnoses.\n\n## Architectures for Multi-modal Learning\n\n### 1. Early Fusion\n- Early fusion approach combines raw data from multiple sensors before any high-level processing or decision-making. It helps capture and process interactions between modalities at the data level.\n  - The advantage here is that we don’t have to perform dedicated processing for each modality (i.e, it only requires a single learning phase)\n  - The downside to this approach is that raw input data may not contain rich semantic information. This means that the model is not able to capture complex interactions between the modalities.\n\n### 2. Late Fusion\n- In this approach, all the modalities are learned independently and are combined right before the model makes a decision. In this type of multimodal, individual models are trained separately for different modes (Text, Vision, etc.) to make a local prediction. These individual results are then combined at a higher level to make the final fused prediction.\n  - The advantage of late fusion is its simplicity and isolation. Each model gets to learn super rich information on its modality.\n  - The downside is that the system is not able to learn complex modal interactions, and thus does not benefit directly from the complementary information each modality might offer.\n  - Another downside is the high compute cost for processing data of each mode separately.\n\n\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ac8c672-625b-4dfc-81b5-54469ac9110e\" alt=\"Image 1\" style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bc6402c-a804-44e9-ad2d-13d5e7c001eb\" alt=\"Image 2\">\n\n\n## Use cases:\n\n1. **Medical Diagnosis**: Multimodal AI assists in medical diagnosis by combining data from various sources. It includes patient records, medical scans, and textual reports. Further, it aids doctors and medical professionals to diagnose and formulate effective patient treatment plans and improve patient care. \n2. **Video Summarization**: The Multimodal Artificial intelligence model facilitates video summarization by extracting audio and visual characteristics. It speeds up content consumption, improves video content management systems, and makes browsing more efficient.  \n3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Multimodal AI can detect and understand human emotions from certain sources, including voice tone, text sentiment, and facial expressions. It assists in sentiment analysis on social media and the mental health support system to gauge and respond to users’ emotional support.  \n\n## Hands on project using PyTorch\n\n### Problem statement\n\n[Fakeddit](https://fakeddit.netlify.app/) is a fine-grained multimodal fake news detection dataset, designed to advance efforts to combat the spread of misinformation in multiple modalities, namely text and image data. The following model was built to classify the data in Fakeddit into 6 pre-defined classes:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/094731e1-5f0d-4c5f-93b0-04b789964a99)\n\n- Authentic/true news content\n- Satire/Parody\n- Content with false connection\n- Imposter content\n- Manipulated content\n- Misleading content\n\nThe following model combines features extracted from text (using BERT) and images (using ResNet50). These features are processed through fully connected layers and combined. The combined features are then passed through a softmax layer to predict the probabilities of each class, which represent whether the news is fake or not. The model is initialized and moved to the specified device for training or inference.\n\n### Let's code\n\nBefore you proceed with this section, it is expected that you have a decent knowledge with the implementation of `pytorch` and its associated deep-learning libraries. For a starting point, you can refer the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).\n\n#### Import the required libraries\nFirst let's ensure you have the right python and deep learning libraries ready.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport urllib.request\nimport sys\nimport random\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score\n\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\nimport torch.nn.functional as f\nimport torch.optim as optim\n\nimport torchvision\nfrom torchvision.transforms import v2\nfrom torchvision import models\nfrom torchvision.models import resnet50, ResNet50_Weights\nimport torch.optim.lr_scheduler as lr_scheduler\nfrom transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer\n```\n\n#### Text Feature Extraction\nIn the Text-Feature Extractor, we used a pre-trained [BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/bert) Model. `BERT`, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a machine learning framework for natural language processing (NLP) trained on the Toronto BookCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\n\n##### Why use BERT and BERT Embeddings in this specific use-case?\n- `BERT` uses a bi-directional approach considering both the left and right context of words in a sentence, instead of analyzing the text sequentially.\n- We use BERT to extract features, namely word and sentence embedding vectors, from text data.\n- These vectors are used as high-quality feature inputs to downstream models. NLP models such as LSTMs or CNNs require inputs in the form of numerical vectors, hence BERT is a good option for encoding variable length text strings.\n\n##### Model Working\n- The model takes the title_input_ids and title_attention_mask as inputs and processes them using BERT.\n- Extracts the [CLS] token representation from the last hidden states of BERT, which serves as a summary of the input text.\n- Applies dropout to the extracted text features.\n- Passes the features through a fully connected layer to map them to the number of classes.\n\n```python\n# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer\nmodel_name = 'bert-base-uncased'\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nbert_model = BertModel.from_pretrained(model_name, output_hidden_states = True)\n\n# Put the model in evaluation mode, which turns off dropout regularization which is used in training.\nbert_model.eval()\n```\n\n```python\ndef get_bert_embedding(text):\n    # Tokenize input text and get token IDs and attention mask\n    inputs = tokenizer.encode_plus(text, add_special_tokens = True, return_tensors='pt', max_length=80, truncation=True, padding='max_length')\n\n    return inputs['input_ids'].squeeze(0), inputs['attention_mask'].squeeze(0)\n```\n\n#### Image Feature Extraction Process\nIn the Image-Feature Extractor, we used a pre-trained [ResNet50](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/resnet-50) model trained on the ImageNet dataset for image classification tasks.\n\n##### Why use ResNet50?\n- ResNet50 is a deep learning model launched in 2015 by Microsoft Research for the purpose of visual recognition. The model is 50 layers deep.\n- ResNet50's architecture (including shortcut connections between layers) significantly improves on the vanishing gradient problems that arise during backpropagation which allows for higher accuracy.\n- The skip connections in ResNet50 facilitate smoother training and faster convergence. Thus making it easier for the model to learn and update weights during training.\n\n##### Model working?\n- The model processes the input image using ResNet50 to extract features.\n- Applies dropout to the extracted image features.\n- Passes the features through a fully connected layer to map them to the number of classes.\n\n#### Feature fusion:\nWe’ve implemented a late fusion architecture for the model. This combines the feature of the two separate modalities.\n\n##### Model working\n- Combines the text and image features using element-wise maximum operation.\n- Applies the softmax function to the combined features to obtain class probabilities.\n\nThis is one of the most crucial steps of building the model and requires careful tuning of the hyperparameters. Refer this [source](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/hyperparameter_tuning_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-hyperparameter-tuning-tutorial-py) to learn more about hyperparameter tuning in deep learning models using PyTorch.\nHere we have set the hyperparameters for you to ensure optimal results.\n```python\nclass BERTResNetClassifier(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_classes=6):\n        super(BERTResNetClassifier, self).__init__()\n\n        self.num_classes = num_classes\n\n        #

Well done!\n\n### Inferences\nAfter training the model on the images of the dataset along with the text modality, we obtain the following metrics after 20 straight epochs.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45d2b7aa-04e3-4641-92b1-7d4172d45d18)\n\nThe model obtains an overall accuracy of 77.47%. If we were to calculate the F1 score as well, we can employ the formula below:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32dd25fb-39d9-4c65-90d1-f9839667cf5a)\n\nThe F1 score is approximately 0.774, which is quite a decent score for a multi-modal task of this scale and underlines the usefulness and future scope for improvement in this field.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy far, multimodal machine learning provides powerful tools for integrating diverse data types, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of models. Through the hands-on project with the FakeEdit dataset, we explored how combining visual and textual data can improve fake news detection. As multimodal approaches continue to evolve, they hold the potential to revolutionize industries by enabling more comprehensive and context-aware AI systems.\n\n## References\n\nThese are some of the references that we have used to write this blog.\n\n[1] [Multi Modal Entailment](https://keras.io/examples/nlp/multimodal_entailment/)\n\n[2] _I.
