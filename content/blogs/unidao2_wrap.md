The world of Web3 and blockchain technology can seem overwhelming at first glance. For many students at NITK, the question wasn't just about where to startâ€”it was about finding the right community to learn and grow with. UniDAO 2.0, a 6-week Ethereum and Web3 boot camp, emerged as that perfect starting point, offering not just technical knowledge but also a gateway to real-world opportunities and lasting connections.


## The Program Structure

UniDAO 2.0 began with an engaging orientation session that set the tone for what was to come. The program welcomed curious minds regardless of their previous experience with blockchain technology. The selection process emphasized enthusiasm and willingness to learn over existing expertise.

## Personal Journey - From Learning to Building
### Shivam's Experience

For Shivam, UniDAO 2.0 was more than just a programâ€”it was a doorway to an entirely new dimension of technology. As someone who started with minimal blockchain knowledge, the curriculum's approachability became his foundation for growth. Each week brought new discoveries: from writing his first smart contract to understanding the intricacies of decentralized systems.

The hands-on learning approach transformed theoretical concepts into tangible skills. Shivam progressed from basic solidity exercises to deploying complex smart contracts, creating interactive dApps, and minting NFTs, building AgriVerify & AI-NFT App. The program's structured path helped him build confidence with each new project, preparing him for bigger challenges ahead.

_"Amazing seniors like **Mardav Bhaiya**, **Apoorva Bhaiya**, **Shubham Bhaiya** and **Ayush Bhaiya**... â€”who are the tech legends of our collegeâ€”played a huge role in guiding us towards Web3. Their constructive feedback was invaluable when I was building **AgriVerify**, a decentralized platform to certify and verify crops on the blockchain. From integrating push notifications and IPFS storage to using NFTs for proof of origin, their support made the journey both insightful and rewarding."_, says Shivam.

This preparation culminated in his participation at ETHIndia'24, where he and his team developed AIgentX, a groundbreaking decentralized marketplace for AI agents. The project showcased how far he'd comeâ€”from learning basic Web3 concepts to building a complex platform that combined AI with blockchain technology. 

His team's achievement at ETHIndia wasn't just about the technical implementation; it represented the journey from curiosity to capability that UniDAO 2.0 had enabled.

Through the bounty system and weekly challenges, Shivam consistently ranked 6th among the top participants, demonstrating how engagement and dedication could accelerate learning. His experience proves that with the right guidance and community support, the leap into Web3 development becomes not just manageable but exciting and rewarding.

### Suyash's Experience

For Suyash, a second-year engineering student, the path to Web3 began with a realization and a friendship. After what felt like a "wasted" first year, he and his friend Vatsal discovered their shared passion for hackathons. Their initial team formed organically: Suyash with his frontend skills, Vatsal handling backend, and his roommate Vishruth bringing machine learning expertise. This early experience taught them a crucial lesson that would shape their future success: _"team chemistry matters more than individual skills"_, says Suyash.

Their Web3 journey truly began with UniDAO 2.0, a collaboration between Devfolio and the Web Enthusiasts' Club NITK. The application process itself was a story of contrasts â€“ while Suyash and Vatsal applied early, their teammate Vishruth squeezed in just before the extended deadline. Fortunately, all three made it in, and UniDAO proved to be transformative. It was here that they found their fourth teammate, Shivam, completing their hackathon dream team.

_"Special thanks goes to seniors like **Ayush Bhaiya**, **Shubham Bhaiya**, and **Apoorva Bhaiya**, who patiently guided us and cleared our doubts. But if thereâ€™s one person who shaped my hackathon journey the most, it was **Mardav Bhaiya**. As a seasoned hackathon winner, he mentored us with insights, tips, and constant encouragement.He was there for us through all the highs and lows his belief in us made all the difference."_, says Suyash.

Their first major challenge came with back-to-back acceptances to Unfold and ETHIndia.

![DS1_6411](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/817f29ab-c001-4d05-bd3f-2788cc9e313d)


At Unfold, they developed [JusticeChain](https://github.com/marcdhi/JusticeChain), an ambitious project targeting India's legal system backlog. The platform featured AI-powered judges, interactive legal simulations, and a decentralized courtroom with smart evidence verification. Despite winning a track prize, the experience taught them valuable lessons about focus, preparation, and the importance of effective presentation.

ETHIndia marked their next milestone. Armed with lessons from Unfold, they pivoted to create AIgentX, a decentralized marketplace for AI agents. The project showcased their growth â€“ featuring custom AI agent creation, tokenization, multi-language support, and autonomous on-chain wallets. Despite coordination challenges and fierce competition, they secured another track pool prize and earned _0.42 ETH_ ðŸ”¥ through quadratic voting.

The hackathon experiences taught them priceless lessons:
- Starting small and building up gradually
- The critical importance of team dynamics
- The value of networking and community building
- Strategic focus in choosing tracks and problem statements
- Adaptability in the face of challenges

Today, Suyash and his team are taking their learning further, refining JusticeChain based on user feedback and expert consultations. Their journey exemplifies how UniDAO 2.0 serves not just as a learning platform but as a springboard for ambitious builders in the Web3 space.

Through setbacks and successes, Suyash's story embodies the UniDAO spirit â€“ showing how curiosity, persistence, and community support can transform novice developers into confident Web3 builders. His experience proves that the path to success isn't just about coding skills; it's about building relationships, learning from failures, and maintaining the courage to keep pushing boundaries.
